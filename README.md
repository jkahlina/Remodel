Remodel
=======

Mac application which offers similar functionality to that of the Snap feature of Windows 7

This was a significant rewrite of the ShiftIt application (https://code.google.com/p/shiftit/) that I did back in 2012 for fun and to customize for my own development needs. Today there are many polished options available for download.

I've used some third party code that I'll fully credit here soon.

More information to come...
