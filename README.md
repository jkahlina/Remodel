# About

This was a significant rewrite of the [ShiftIt][1] application by [Aravindkumar Rajendiran][2] that was started in 2012 for fun and to customize for personal development needs. Today there are many polished options available for download and the original project is continued [here][3]. This project is currently not being actively developed.

## Disclaimer

This code is mostly experimental, so it is not as polished as I'd like it to be :)

## Third Party Code

I've used some code that was not written by me:

* Classes from [ShortcutReader][4] for key code transforming
* Code from [bdunagan][5] for startup lauching
* [STPrivilegedTask][6] for privileged tasks
